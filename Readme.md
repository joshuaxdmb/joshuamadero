# My Personal Website
This was my first ever website, back in 2019 (started out of Github). It started as my mechatronics portfolio, to apply for my first internship.
I should probably rewrite it in React to avoid having so much duplication... I will make a new repo for this, and keep this as a reminder of how far I've as a software developer!
